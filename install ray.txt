pip install ray -> basic ray


PC with RTX 3080 Ti (GPU-Accelerated Ray Installation)

    Install Ray:

pip install ray

Install CUDA and cuDNN: To leverage the GPU, install NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN libraries compatible with your GPU and Ray's GPU dependencies:

    Download CUDA Toolkit: NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit
    Download cuDNN: NVIDIA cuDNN

Check the compatibility between your CUDA version and Python/Ray dependencies. For example:

    CUDA 11.8 is compatible with most recent Python libraries.

Set Up Environment Variables (optional but recommended): Add the paths for CUDA and cuDNN binaries to your environment variables:

export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Install Ray with GPU Support: Install libraries for GPU-accelerated machine learning, such as TensorFlow or XGBoost:

pip install ray[default]
pip install ray[rllib] ray[tune] ray[train]  # Add specific packages as needed

Verify GPU Access: Test Ray with GPU support using:

import ray
ray.init()
print(ray.available_resources())

Look for entries like "GPU": 1.0 in the output.
